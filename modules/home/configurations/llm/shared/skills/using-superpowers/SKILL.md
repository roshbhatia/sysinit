# Using Superpowers

## CRITICAL RULE

If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.**

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

## How to Access Skills

Invoke the Skill tool with the skill name. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly.

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Process Flow

```
1. User message received
2. Ask: Might any skill apply?
3. If yes (even 1%): Invoke Skill tool
4. Announce: "Using [skill] to [purpose]"
5. Has checklist? Create TodoWrite todo per item
6. Follow skill exactly
7. Respond (including clarifications)
```

## Red Flags - STOP

These thoughts mean you're rationalizing:

- "This is just a simple question" - Questions are tasks. Check for skills.
- "I need more context first" - Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions.
- "Let me explore the codebase first" - Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first.
- "I can check git/files quickly" - Files lack conversation context. Check for skills.
- "Let me gather information first" - Skills tell you HOW to gather information.
- "This doesn't need a formal skill" - If a skill exists, use it.
- "I remember this skill" - Skills evolve. Read current version.
- "This doesn't count as a task" - Action = task. Check for skills.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (test-driven-development, using-git-worktrees) - these guide execution

Examples:
- "Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills
- "Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then domain-specific skills

## Final Note

This skill exists to remind you: **skills are not optional when they apply.**

If you're about to do work, you probably need a skill.
