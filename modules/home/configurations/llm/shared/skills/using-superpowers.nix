# Using Superpowers

## CRITICAL RULE

If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.**

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

## How to Access Skills

Invoke the Skill tool with the skill name. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly.

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Process Flow

```
1. User message received
2. Ask: Might any skill apply?
3. If yes (even 1%): Invoke Skill tool
4. Announce: "Using [skill] to [purpose]"
5. Has checklist? Create TodoWrite todo per item
6. Follow skill exactly
7. Respond (including clarifications)
```

## Red Flags - STOP

These thoughts mean you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (test-driven-development, using-git-worktrees) - these guide execution

Examples:
- "Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills
- "Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then domain-specific skills

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (test-driven-development, systematic-debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (brainstorming, executing-plans): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
