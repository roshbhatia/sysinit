# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this session, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

Before claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. **IDENTIFY**: What command proves this claim?
2. **RUN**: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. **READ**: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. **VERIFY**: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. **ONLY THEN**: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

### Tests

✅ **Good**: `[Run test command]` → `[See: 34/34 pass]` → "All tests pass"

❌ **Bad**: "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"

### Regression Tests (TDD Red-Green)

✅ **Good**: Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)

❌ **Bad**: "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)

### Build

✅ **Good**: `[Run build]` → `[See: exit 0]` → "Build passes"

❌ **Bad**: "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)

### Requirements

✅ **Good**: Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion

❌ **Bad**: "Tests pass, phase complete"

### Agent Delegation

✅ **Good**: Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state

❌ **Bad**: Trust agent report

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## Why This Matters

Verification failures lead to:
- Undefined functions shipped → crashes
- Missing requirements shipped → incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework
- Trust broken with human partners ("I don't believe you")
- Violates core value: "Honesty. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
