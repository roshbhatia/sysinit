  This skill teaches effective use of **beads** (`bd`), a distributed git-backed issue tracker designed for AI agents. Use beads to track tasks, manage dependencies, and coordinate work across sessions.

  ## Getting Started

  First, check if beads is available and initialized:

  ```bash
  # Check if bd is installed
  bd version

  # Check if current project has beads initialized
  bd status
  ```

  **If `bd` is not installed**, ask the user which installation method they prefer:
  - **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`
  - **Homebrew:** `brew install beads` (macOS)
  - **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`

  Do not install without user confirmation, as these are global system packages.

  **If not initialized in the project**, run:
  ```bash
  bd init
  ```

  For personal use on shared projects (won't commit to repo):
  ```bash
  bd init --stealth
  ```

  For contributors on forked repos (routes to separate planning repo):
  ```bash
  bd init --contributor
  ```

  ## Essential Commands

  | Command | Purpose |
  |---------|---------|
  | `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers (what to work on next) |
  | `bd create "Title" -p 1` | Create a task (priority 0-3, lower = higher priority) |
  | `bd show <id>` | View task details and dependencies |
  | `bd list` | List all open issues |
  | `bd close <id>` | Mark task as complete |
  | `bd update <id> --status in_progress` | Update task status |
  | `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Create dependency (child blocked by parent) |
  | `bd sync` | Force immediate sync to git |

  **Always use `--json` flag** for machine-readable output when parsing results.

  ## Task Hierarchy

  Beads supports hierarchical IDs for organizing work:

  - `bd-a3f8` — Epic (large feature)
  - `bd-a3f8.1` — Task under epic
  - `bd-a3f8.1.1` — Sub-task

  Create hierarchical tasks:
  ```bash
  bd create "Epic: User Authentication" -t epic -p 1
  bd create "Implement login flow" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8
  ```

  ## Session Workflow

  ### Starting a Session

  ```bash
  # See what's ready to work on
  bd ready --json

  # Pick a task and mark it in progress
  bd update <id> --status in_progress

  # View full details
  bd show <id> --json
  ```

  ### During Work

  ```bash
  # Create new tasks as you discover them
  bd create "Fix edge case in validation" -p 2

  # Add dependencies
  bd dep add <new-task> <blocking-task>

  # Update task with notes
  bd update <id> --notes "Found issue with timezone handling"
  ```

  ### Ending a Session ("Land the Plane")

  When finishing work, complete ALL these steps:

  ```bash
  # 1. File issues for remaining work
  bd create "TODO: Add integration tests" -p 2

  # 2. Close completed tasks
  bd close <id> --reason "Completed"

  # 3. Sync and push (MANDATORY)
  git pull --rebase
  bd sync
  git push

  # 4. Verify push succeeded
  git status  # Must show "up to date with origin"

  # 5. Identify next task for follow-up
  bd ready --json
  ```

  **CRITICAL**: Always push before ending a session. Unpushed work causes coordination problems in multi-agent workflows.

  ## Important Rules

  ### DO use `bd update` with flags
  ```bash
  bd update <id> --description "new description"
  bd update <id> --title "new title"  
  bd update <id> --design "design notes"
  bd update <id> --notes "additional notes"
  bd update <id> --acceptance "acceptance criteria"
  bd update <id> --status in_progress
  ```

  ### DO NOT use `bd edit`
  The `edit` command opens an interactive editor (`$EDITOR`) which AI agents cannot use. Always use `bd update` with flags instead.

  ### DO sync before ending sessions
  ```bash
  bd sync  # Forces immediate export, commit, and push
  ```

  Without `bd sync`, changes sit in a 30-second debounce window and may not be committed.

  ### DO include issue IDs in commit messages
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Fix auth validation bug (bd-abc)"
  ```

  This enables `bd doctor` to detect orphaned issues.

  ## Dependency Types

  ```bash
  # Hard blocker - child cannot start until parent is done
  bd dep add <child> <parent> --type blocks

  # Soft link - related but not blocking  
  bd dep add <issue1> <issue2> --type related

  # Parent-child - hierarchical relationship
  bd dep add <child> <parent> --type parent-child
  ```

  ## Handling Merge Conflicts

  If conflicts occur in `.beads/issues.jsonl`:

  ```bash
  # Accept remote version
  git checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl

  # Re-import to database
  bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl

  # Continue with your work
  ```

  ## Git Hooks (Recommended)

  Install hooks for automatic sync:

  ```bash
  bd hooks install
  ```

  This prevents stale JSONL problems by auto-syncing on commit, merge, push, and checkout.

  ## MCP Server Alternative

  For tighter integration, beads also offers an MCP server (`beads-mcp`) that provides tools directly to your agent. Install via:

  ```bash
  pip install beads-mcp
  ```

  The CLI (`bd`) and MCP server work with the same underlying database.

  ## Quick Reference

  ```bash
  # What should I work on?
  bd ready

  # Create a task
  bd create "Fix bug in login" -p 1

  # Start working
  bd update bd-xyz --status in_progress

  # Done working
  bd close bd-xyz --reason "Completed"
  bd sync
  git push
  ```
