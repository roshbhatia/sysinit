I'm working on modularizing my Neovim config. Current structure:
- Core module system for plugin/test management
- Layout module for panel/window management
- Theme module for colorscheme management
- Keybinding module using legendary.nvim

Looking to:
1. Migrate remaining plugins to module system
2. Improve test coverage and verification
3. Implement proper dependency management
